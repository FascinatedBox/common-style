common-style
============

This repository stores a self-contained (no images) dark mode stylesheet for use
in various Qt projects. I've uploaded this repository primarily so others can
see my process. I doubt this is useful to others, and I don't mind if you copy
it.

The stylesheet here is a modification of a basic stylesheet created by
BreezeStyleSheets.
